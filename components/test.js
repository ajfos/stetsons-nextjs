// The AsyncParagraph component is used for rendering a paragraph whose value is changed by an async function.
// The component will receive as props:
// ï‚· dataVersion - a version of the data.
// ï‚· loadData - a function that returns a Promise that resolves to a string.
// The component should only invoke the loadData function on the first render and every time the dataVersion or
// loadData props are changed. The string that is returned from loadData should be rendered in a paragraph element.
// For example, if the component is rendered like this:
<AsyncParagraph
  dataVersion="10"
  loadData={() => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      resolve("Data!");
    });
  }}
/>;
// the component should render to:
{
  /* <p>Data!</p>
Answer */
}
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
const AsyncParagraph = (props) => {
  props.loadData().then((data) => {
    return <p>{data}</p>;
  });
};
document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='root'></div>";
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <AsyncParagraph
    dataVersion="10"
    loadData={() => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("Data!");
      });
    }}
  />

setTimeout(() => console.log(document.getElementById("root").innerHTML), 300);
